# Project Outline

> “Using components sourced from your Sparkfun Arduino kit, create an alarm that triggers when a person approaches your device. Your device should be capable of the following...

> Detect the presence of a person approaching your device
> Respond to the presence of this person by blinking and LED , setting off a piezo buzzer, sweeping a servo motor, printing out a warning to an LCD screen, or any combination of light, sound, motion, and text.
> Reset the alarm by pushing a button”

## Constraints

  For this project, I was limited to using a limited selection of Arduino Parts and using an Arduino Uno. I was given 7 class days as well as extended work time in advisory for a total of around 18 hours of work time.
